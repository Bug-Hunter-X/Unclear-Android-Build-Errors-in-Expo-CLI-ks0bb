This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android APK. It happens when there are issues with the Android build process, particularly related to the dependencies or configuration of the project.  The error message itself is not always very informative, but it often indicates problems with native modules, missing dependencies, or misconfigurations in the `android/` directory of your Expo project.  It might manifest as a generic build failure or a more specific error related to Gradle or the Android build system.
