# Unclear Android Build Errors in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when building Android APKs using Expo CLI. The problem is characterized by vague error messages during the build process, making it challenging to identify and resolve the root cause.  This repo provides example code and solutions to illustrate the types of problems that can lead to these opaque errors and how to approach debugging them.

## Bug Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains example code demonstrating a scenario where the Android build might fail.  This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as missing dependencies, incorrect configurations in `android/app/build.gradle`, or issues with native modules.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers potential solutions and debugging strategies for these obscure build errors. It focuses on examining the full error log from the Expo CLI build process for clues, checking dependencies, and ensuring proper configuration of your Android project.  It also emphasizes the importance of reviewing the Gradle build logs found in the `android/.gradle` directory for more detailed error messages.
