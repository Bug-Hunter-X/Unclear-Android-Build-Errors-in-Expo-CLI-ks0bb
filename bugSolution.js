The solution involves a systematic debugging approach:

1. **Examine the Full Error Log:** The Expo CLI build output often contains additional information that may provide clues to the problem.  Look for specific errors or warnings.  Consider using a log analysis tool to streamline the identification of relevant messages.
2. **Check Dependencies:** Make sure all necessary dependencies for your project are correctly specified in `package.json`.   Run `expo install` to install or update packages.
3. **Verify Android Configuration:** Review the `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/settings.gradle` files to ensure accurate configurations for your project. Ensure correct paths and dependencies.
4. **Gradle Logs:** The Android build process typically produces detailed log files in the `android/.gradle` directory. Inspect these logs for more specific error messages.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild can resolve temporary build issues. Try running `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android`.
6. **Native Modules:** If using native modules, verify their installation and configuration carefully.  Ensure correct linking and setup for the respective module.
